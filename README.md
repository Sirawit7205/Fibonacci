# Fibonacci
16-bit Fibonacci calculator with logic ICs

A circuit that calculates fibonacci up to 46,368 using only logic chips (except the display).

This project is mostly intended as a soldering practice because the PIC microcontroller featured on the board is fully capable of calculating fibonacci anyway without all the logic chips.

There are two versions of PCB, through-hole and SMD. Both versions use the same circuit and have the same physical size (4x6 inches: will fit most postcard frames).

The only difference is the PIC microcontroller used, both code also work the same way.
